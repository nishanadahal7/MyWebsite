        <h1>7 Elements of Art</h1>
        <section>
          <p>In this website, I have decided to help people who are new to art. Even I am not good at art and I'm still learning as I go. I will be presenting
          this website to you guys by showing pictures from a art that "ok" to very skilled  arts and explain how it has been done
         and what can you do to your arts to make it look like it is a wodk that is done by a Professional.

           There are 7 elements of Art. The visual components of color, form, line, shape, space, texture, and value.</p>
        </section>

         <section>
           <h2> LINE</h2>
           <p> The first element is line. Line is the basic forms of art. It express different meaning. Some artists use nothinf but line to express shapes, values, textures,and space and forms.
            An element of art defined by point moving in space. Line may be two-or-three-dimensional, descriptive, implied, or abstract.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SHAPE</h2>
          <p> An element of art that is two-dimensiona, flat, or liited to height and width. There are two types of shape, Geometric and organic shapes. Geometric shapes are precise and ruglar like
            rectangles, trigangles, and squres. Oraganic shapes are irregular and they tipicallyt come from nature such as leaves, flowers, and clouds shape. I feel like you can create any art work
            from any types of shapes.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>COLOR</h2>
          <p> The second element is color. Colors have three properties and they are hue, valve, and intensity. Hue refers to color red, blue, and green just to name few. Value refers to lightness or
            darkness of the view. For example, dark green versus light green. Intensity refers to purity of color. An example of intensity is that red is more intense than orange is more intensely yellow.</p>
